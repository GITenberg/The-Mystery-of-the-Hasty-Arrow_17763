description: Groundbreaking mystery writer Anna Katherine Green is regarded as one
  of the most important early innovators in the genre and one of the most procedurally
  and scientifically accurate of most early detective fiction authors. Although The
  Mystery of the Hasty Arrow is a classic Green novel in its pulse-pounding plot and
  scientific detail, this mystery also adds a layer of psychological complexity that
  will thrill suspense fans.
